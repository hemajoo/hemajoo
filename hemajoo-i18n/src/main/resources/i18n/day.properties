day.FRIDAY.etymology=The name Friday comes from the Old English fr??edæ?, meaning the "day of Frig", a result of an old convention associating the Germanic goddess Frigg with the Roman goddess Venus, with whom the day is associated in many different cultures. The same holds for Fr?atag in Old High German, Freitag in Modern German, and vrijdag in Dutch.
